	 		<p><strong>You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory | Johnny Thunder</strong> This seems like less a song, more a… statement? Manifesto? That’s not to say I don’t like it. It’s attractively cynical. And has its poppy moments, too — I like the dips at the end of each line: “They let you kno-<i>ow</i>.” Also, I looked him up: Can’t believe he’s not British! </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>The Classical | The Fall</strong> The Fall are your latest fixation, right? I don’t think I’m on board. They have a lot in common with Pavement’s lesser tendencies. Redeeming bits: “Hey there, fuckface!,” the percussion, and a handful of unorthodox guitar fills.  </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Shark Smile | Big Thief</strong> Oh, nice one! Real solid, catchy tune. Love the chord progression. Modest but just-right production, too. I’ve seen the band name around before — hyperlinked on Wikipedia, suggested by Spotify’s algorithms — but never listened. Happy to be formally introduced. Now, admit it: Your favorite kind of vocals are sultry, low-register, female. And I bet you learned this one. Total Black Cat Holiday cover material.  </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Daddy's Song | Harry Nilsson</strong> Is he a Zappa-type? Musical prodigy who eschewed pop for the experimental? This is a fun listen. Dep lyrics and perky melody are a goofy match. Highlights: The stereo-bouncing throat clears at the start, and the skat later on.  Again: I expected him to be British. </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Beyond Belief | Elvis Costello & The Attractions</strong> Power pop has been growing on me these last few months. Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe… you too? Love the outro: “I got a fee-ee-eeling / I’m gonna get a lot of grief.” Thanks for this one.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>In Particular | Blonde Redhead</strong> I dig the intro guitar fills. I’m imaging the tabs: -0h2p0h2p0-. We’d have closed the browser, dejected, in 2004. And the fill that kicks in at 2:08 is boss.  A *bit* lengthy for my taste. What do people do at Blonde Redhead concerts? Eat DMT and sway back and forth? </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Venus | Television</strong> Great voice, guitar work, bridge riff, production. This is my formal introduction to Television. I’ve heard the Strokes compared to them; I agree. I believe Casablancas denies their influence, but he’s probably lying. Aside: Drummer reminds me of Bob. Send me more Television.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Extramundane | Bedhead</strong> Here it is: the stand-out, the gold-medalist. I have listened to this song scores of times since you shared this mix. Whoa. The interlude at 1:20 is beautiful. And the guitar solo… incredibly unassuming, but spectacular. I am montaging nonstop.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>I Don't Want To Get Over You | The Magnetic Fields</strong> This song is seriously transporting me to my dorm room in 2007/8. The Magnetic Fields must have released an album that year, and Neels had it on repeat. It’s so familiar. Moving on: I like the vibe and the voice. The lyrics are cheesy and overly-angsty — but maybe that’s ironic? </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) | Kate Bush</strong> Another gold medal. Truly epic song. (It better be, with that title.) Her voice is stunning; Stevie Nicks feels threatened.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
			<p><strong>Hymne | Vangelis</strong> <i>Another gold medal!</i> Permission to play this song as you and the other pallbearers march my casket down St. Theresea’s center aisle. I’m embarrassed I wasn’t familiar with Vangelis (although I’m sure I’ve listened to his scores over the years). He’s now on repeat regularly during the workday.  </p>

	 		<h5>~</h5>
	 		<p><strong>Dave's Song & No Woman | Whitney</strong> Grouping these together, as i am the whole album (Light Upon the Lake). This is a good band, they are not showy, don't feel pretentious. No Woman sounds like it came from McCartney's first solo album. Dave's Song has DAT bass, easy-going relaxing tunes. I really wonder if they fuck or party on tour, I picture them married already and with dogs on buses. Don't picture them actually being rock stars. I refuse to google pictures of them, i know i will be disappointed. Probably look like absolute pieces of shit. Bands don't know how to look cool anymore. </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Loro | Pinback</strong> I knew this song, i have this album in my collection. I love the guitar and bass interplay on all their stuff. The recording is so simple too, definitely can be done on 4 tracks. They can be monotonous over time but they have a great sound. They are like a weaker Built To Spill. I listened to this in my backyard while the sun went down, but I was picturing it being Fall and leaves everywhere and a slight chill in the air. I think that's the time for them to come back around. I hope they aren't poor and have a comfortable life, they definitely will not be remembered in 50 years in any capacity. We could probably be in this band.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>King Of A One Horse Town | Dan Auerbach</strong> Most punchable face outside of Adam Levine. Can't stand this fuckhead, i've seen him as a talking head on some shows/documentaries. Wants to come across as some tortured songwriter but he's def just a middle aged white boy who grew up with money. Maybe that's why I like jamming to his Black Keys stuff, i can relate to being so blatantly average. As for the song, it's pleasing enough, it doesn't bother me. It just doesn't sound like anything I haven't heard. I'd rather reach for some older R&B stuff.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Alaska | Maggie Rogers</strong> When it first started, i thought you lost your mind. Then it grows on you. The chorus is SO familiar, I definitely have heard it in a show or movie or radio. Solid hook, nice voice, chill, definitely something to revisit when making mixes for a get together. I'm getting a lot of CHILL from this mix, what is that saying about you I wonder. Probably nothing.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Powerful Man | Alex G</strong> Don't know why he changed his name, pretty dumb. Shocked when i saw an Alex G song on here, then i remembered you mentioned liking one of his songs. I did not know this song or album. He is still lo-fi, charming production. This kid is a dream, blows up in college playing songs and releasing them on cassettes. Gets a rolling stone write-up. Just a goofy kid. It's good, you should revisit the album DSU. Maybe the laughter was wrong? Or maybe he's matured now and I was too early. This is very bathtub headphones type music. </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>What Deaner Was Talking About | Ween</strong> Absolute standout track. One of the best songs I have ever heard in my life. Thank you. Has a montage effect to it, which i blame on the flanger/phaser/whatever the fuck that is. Perfect song, just chords and melody. No flashy riffage, no noodling for days. Just a song. "If i was king, I'd wear a ring" is the most Kevin lyric I've ever heard too. You could have wrote that. The album cover is titillating too, I have seen it before, never knew it was Ween. I need to mine this band's discog asap.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Spaceflight | Efence</strong> The only song on the mix I just didn't get into on any level. There are many videogames with better soundtracks. It just wasn't interesting enough, and the production was too much, no dynamics. I can see you working out or something to this song, so i can respect that. But to throw on my free time, pass.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Where We're Going | Hans Zimmer</strong> This soundtrack really wrapped you up in the movie. I thought it was fantastic. It is an homage to pieces of Philip Glass' soundtrack to that Koyaasaquitu documentary, specifically the second half of the song which builds up. Hanz Zimmer always has good scores, I don't know how these guys continuously come up with hooks. </p>

	 		<h5>~</h5>
	 		<p><strong>Night | John Carpenter</strong> No other words than "sinister," one of Mikey's favorite adjectives. Excellent soundtrack for driving at night. Or, when seething with anger—it has a calming effect, oddly. Digression: I received "Escape From New York" on DVD for Christmas ~1999. Treasured possession.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Stand Back | Stevie Nicks</strong> Fleetwood Mac and all associated acts are among the most prolific and consistent hit makers. Her voice is top 10.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Search | Tangerine Dream</strong> This seems like it's from the Pokemon Blue soundtrack. I mean that as praise. I listened to this song on repeat while wandering Grand Central, after missing a train. Great soundtrack for plumbing windy underground corridors.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Mad World | Tears For Fears</strong> Respect for laying the groundwork, but Gary Jules much improved this one. (Like how The Pixies' Head On cover is better than the original.) The Jules version was seminal listening for a sulking 15-year-old KZ. </p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>The Flat Earth | Thomas Dolby</strong> Cool mix of dissonance and steady rhythm, plus the backing vocals are great. The guy looks like he rides around in a hot air balloon.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>It's My Life | Talk Talk</strong> A strong, solid synth pop song. The pre-bridge lick ("one half won't do") is beautiful. How many people think this is a No Doubt original?</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Warszawa | David Bowie</strong> Sorry to say Bowie has never impressed me. He looks cool. But to me he's the Foo Fighters—big name, mediocre catalogue.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Kangaroo | This Mortal Coil</strong> Incredibly JJ song. Anthem for perusing Good Wills in 1984. They must've been friends with The Cure.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Weird Science | Oingo Boingo</strong> When you're in the mood for it, it's perfect. When you're not in the mood for it, it's beyond grating.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Metamorphosis: Metamorphosis Two | Philip Glass</strong> I like listening to Philip Glass while working. Sometimes it's a little too dissonant, and breaks my concentration. But it's still great music.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Bizarre Love Triangle | New Order</strong> Best song on the mixtape; thank you for the introduction. Have listened to it countless times over the past six months. Gold medal material: the melody, the lyrics, the orchestration, everything.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>The Model | Kraftwerk</strong> lol.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>I Feel Love | Donna Summer</strong> Makes me think of our parents dancing at weddings in the '70s. Parachute-baggy trousers, wireframe glasses, pit stains, an out-of-focus seafood buffet in the background.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Falling | Julee Cruise</strong> Not a bad song, but too much dep. Maybe I'll spin this again when I'm dying.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>You Might Think | The Cars</strong> Reliable hit makers, but it feels like they sold their whole discography to Applebees. All I think of is 2 for $20.</p>

	 		<p><strong>Lazaretto | Jack White</strong> I have been distant from Jack White’s output since the early noughties. Didn’t know he was doing stuff like this. Interesting. Reminds me of Ween, who I have been digging lately. I see Mikey gravitating toward the breakdown at 1:57. Is “Lazaretto” a portmanteau of “Lazarus” and “ghetto”? High point: Drum fill at 2:45 that gives way to a screeching strings section.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Water Fountain | Tune Yards</strong> (Gold medal.) Very cool song. Thank you for the introduction.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Chimes At Midnight | Mastadon</strong> (Bronze medal [Get it?].) Has a very grand feel to it. Metal is growing on to me—I’m learning to seek out the creative guitar lines, the drummer’s precision, etc. I hope one day my ban from Mastadon’s fan forum is lifted. High point: When they take it up a few octaves at 2:21.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Panic Becomes Despair | Thantifaxath</strong> “Metal is growing on to me”… but I’m not quite here yet. De gustibus non est disputandum. I do appreciate their mythology, though—not revealing their identities, playing in hooded cloaks, etc.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Archangel | USA out of Vietnam</strong> At 4:09, nice. I am transported to a fog-capped mountaintop. I feel a supernatural presence. (They make you work for it, though.)</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Huey Newton | St. Vincent</strong>  Infectious synth riff. Nice, chugging drumbeat. Cool fuzzy bass at 2:39. Love the phrase “motherless creatures”; it’s poetic. Did you know Huey Newton once gave a speech at St. Vincent Church in Oakland? Small world. (Also, not true.)</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>She Loves Us | Swans</strong> Aggressive riff—I felt threatened, unsafe. I considered calling for help. They drag it on at length before introducing the rest of the band – definitely toying with the listener. That’s cool. I can’t imagine writing a 17-minute song; you either have it in you, or you don’t. When the singer first came it, he sounded like Stephen Malkmus to me. Do you hear the resemblance? Also, interesting album art. What’s it mean? I have a few ideas. High point: The second act at 7:54.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Refusing A Heavenly Mansion | Jute Gyte</strong> Demonic. I liked this critic’s Jekyll and Hyde quip: “And when I met Adam I was a little shocked when you consider the nasty and abrasive nature of albums like Old, Ways, Verstiegenheit and his latest effort, Impermanence. Well spoken, intelligent, unassuming and critically knowledgeable about music, I should be glad the racket he produces is so vitriolic as the Jekyll and Hyde effect would be a terrible thing if it manifested itself outside of his music.”</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>American Horror | Speedy Ortiz</strong> (Silver medal.) Very first riff got me. Love the chorus effect on the second guitar. Great voice, too.</p>

	 		<p><strong>Bring Me Your Loves | St. Vincent</strong> Annie Clark becomes a queen on her new record. Intense but with some fun in it. I believe the recent Big Black cover jon shared proves she's earned a place on "the artists to be considered seriously" list.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Never Tell | Violent Femmes</strong> My all time fave Femmes track. Everyone is all about Blister and the first record. Hallowed Ground kills. John Zorn plays on Black Girls. Unmistakable.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Nan Ding | Slint</strong> You know fellas, I don't love Slint. I think their stuff is great but falls short of love. I think it is ultimately the vocals. Or lack. This tracks floats along, never builds, is just kinda there...drummer kills...</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Four Enclosed Walls | PIL</strong> And speaking of shitty voices. I never liked Johnny Rotten's much. The drum sound on this track is rightly lauded but the track does little for me otherwise. Another example of JJ's weird anglophilia. He likes his Brits. But strangely not into Blur. He is a mystery man, our friend Jon.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong> I am the cosmos | Chris Bell</strong> Very Beatle-y. Still have yet to come around to Big Star. Their records sound like they were recorded underwater. This song is pleasant enough, a bit repetitive. I really want to see you again...20X...Enough dude.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Chrome Country | Oneohtrix Point Never</strong> Sounds like the Williamsburg Female Choir taking a shit on Heaven's lawn. Just fucking. It is cool. Like the atypical structure, no verse-chorus-verse...Floaty in a positive sense. Makes me want to listen to Grimes.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Death's Door | Uncle Acid and the deadbeats</strong> Sounds like it is playing through a speaker with a ripped cone in a 1974 dorm room. Have to think that was intentional.  Very Sabbath-y. The Quietus loves these guys. I remain un-blown away.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Almost Ready | Dinosaur Jr.</strong> Ahh. Nope. Never could get into these guys. Respect and all, but I'm putting it on for pleasure.</p>

	 		<p><strong>The Central Scrutinizer | Frank Zappa</strong> Fun song. Sounds like something that would be playing on repeat in a re-education camp. "The death penalty... or affect your parents' credit rating." Heh heh.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Inca Roads | Frank Zappa</strong> Very dance-able. I also dig the paranormal sound effects and Ancient Aliens motif. I bet this was a fun one to see live.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Dumb All Over | Frank Zappa</strong> That opening riff—must be the '80s. I am looking forward to learning. Lyrics: very preachy!</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>T'Mershi Duween | Frank Zappa</strong> I had trouble forecasting a new snare hit... scents of prog...</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Dupree's Paradise | Frank Zappa</strong> Probably my favorite on the mix. Clean, catchy horn sounds. Also has a movie score vibe. Will be listening to it again.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Teen-age Wind | Frank Zappa</strong> Nice chant at the two-minute mark.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Plastic People | Frank Zappa</strong> Off-pitch "Louie Louie" made me laugh. Catchy '60s tune buried in there at the 50-second mark. I like that the most. (But does that make me a plastic person?)</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Flower Punk | Frank Zappa</strong> Very funny!</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Who Are The Brain Police? | Frank Zappa</strong> Altered state required for intended experience?</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Echidna's Arf (Of You) | Frank Zappa</strong> This is what I always pictured Zappa sounding like.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Wind Up Workin' In A Gas Station | Frank Zappa</strong> I know you love that guitar solo. It's crunchy. Gas station attendants usually die young because of fumes.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Pinocchio's Furniture | Frank Zappa</strong> Jam band-y. No doubt he's talented.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>My Guitar Want To Kill Your Mama | Frank Zappa</strong> Head-bobber. Fun, too.</p>

	 		<p><strong>Payne's Baby | Beirut</strong> Beautiful song. I love the outro (and, unfortunately, thought of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taQYm54oBog">this</a>). I think we've discussed Beirut before—one of the best singers out there now.</p> 
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Dramamine | Modest Mouse</strong> Great tune. Bass playing the melody, sparse and ethereal guitar, creative drum beat—reminds me of Kid Nixon.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>In Your Mind | Built To Spill</strong> The lyrics just keep going and going. Which is fine—they're great. Also, one of the two following statements is true: BTS's Doug Martsch is currently dating a 22-year-old blonde with **** ****; Doug Martsch's wife is a mild-mannered poet who occasionally helps him with lyrics.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Fleur de Lys | Juliana Hatfield</strong> Catchy. Invites a swaying motion, like many Stone Temple Pilot songs.</p>

	 		<p><strong>Montana | Frank Zappa</strong> I dig. I need to explore more Zappa. Keep the recommendations coming.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Firth of Faith | Genesis</strong> I dig the piano riff. To be honest, the only other Genesis song I'm even remotely familiar with is Squonk. But namedrop that song to a Genesis fan and they go wild. Why's that, I wonder.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>The Prisoner | Iron Maiden</strong> Yehaw. We should jam this next time we're together.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Skankin' to the Beat | Fishbone</strong> Excellent.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Mirror in the Bathroom, | The English Beat</strong> Did 12-year-old Mikey love spinning this track while brooding in his Yorktown bedroom?</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Ghost Town | The Specials</strong> I know you pantomime the opening drums when you listen to this.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Screen Shot | The Swans</strong> Ooh, I'm getting a Too Soon To Swoon vibe.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Family Snapshot | Peter Gabriel</strong> People say Peter Gabriel's consciousness left his body during a particularly potent acid trip, and another entity took up residence in his earthly form before Gabriel's essence could return. Gabriel is still searching for a vessel—will you accommodate? Seriously, though, I like his music, and it really requires the listener's full attention.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Pennroyal Tea | Kristin Hersh</strong> Respectable cover for sure. Did her dowdy look prevent her solo career from taking off?</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Song For The Dead | Queens of the Stone Age</strong> Chants and guitar fills, very Mikey. I also like it. But to me, QotSA's opus will always be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88r_q7oufE">this</a>.

	 		<h4>"Hate to say it, but Marotta would like this band"</h4>
	 		<h5>Mix by KZ, dossier by JJ | May 2013 | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thadzaw/playlist/6OpQSzTpbBMrukhKqBTHHI">Listen</a> </h5>
	 		<h5>~</h5>
	 		<p><strong>Ageless Beauty | Stars</strong> (A, silver medal.) Catchy as hell, love the guitar sound. It's like a Drive soundtrack rock song. Dig the voice, the nostalgic effect, the montage, whole package. Definitely jammable too. Started out with a real bang with this one. *Signature moment: when the guitar slides down between notes at six seconds in. </p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Cruel To Be Kind | Nick Lowe</strong> (B.) This guy is kind of a legend isn't he? Powerpop God. PROLIFIC MUCH? One of those songs where the verse is much better than the chorus. Chorus is too strut-stop disco for me.  but dudes got a voice to boot with his songwriting so guess hes a champ. Signature moment: The beach boys acapella scale climbing moment at 1:42.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Only Child | Moon King</strong> (C.) Is it a girl singing, or a dude? Or BOTH? Tough to decipher. Very Vec song. Got a Feist meets Grimes speed-dreampop feel. It goes by fast, short and sweet i like that. Think its a grower for me though, didnt hate it didnt love it. It just exists. </p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Dark Wave | Stephen Malkmus</strong> (A.) Great song. Dude is so legit, he deserves a place on mt rushmore of songwriting but will never be shown the respect he deserves. every single band has ripped off everything he has ever done. Shitty bands like Phantom Planet needs to pay Malkmus royalties for this song. His lyrics are way too obsure sometimes wish i could relate. Thats my only complaint with him. *Signature Moment- the guitar/keyboard riff with his humming into the dangerously mysterious riff.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>A Well Respected Man | The Kinks</strong> (A.) I listen to this song in my car when I drive to Mt Vernon West. Makes me dep every time. Biggest fucking mistake i ever made. Deja Vu city. I like how the singer sounds like he doesnt give a fuck when he sings. Signature Moment- the lyrics, the backyard fags line and dad passing on lyrics are great.  </p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Myth Takes | !!!</strong> (D.) Overall terrible song. Awful vocals, melody. surprised you dig this. I like the rockabilly riff a lot so just steal that and move on. The bass playing is also on point at least.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Knock Yourself Out | Jon Brion</strong> (A+, gold medal.)  Great song from a great soundtrack. He is a great producer and songwriter who is just known for producing and playing bass on Fiona Apple and Aimee Mann records. Good dude great song. A happier more uplifting elliott smith. but we dont want too much happiness in our music do we. Signature Moment- perfect use of the harmonica.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>The Skin Of My Yellow Country Teeth | Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</strong> (A-, bronze medal.) The gameboy opening drone almost threw me off along with the dance drums but the bass playing, little guitar interludes and his awful voice kept me involved.  Signature moment- the bass and guitar kid nixon parts. We could have wrote this for sure. Not sure if they have other stuff I would like because they need a new band name stat.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Muck | Dinosaur Jr</strong> (A-.) Was unfamiliar with this song but i really dig it. The Frush guitar and his double tracked vocals hooked me. Its a fast paced relaxing song. His voice is good even if he is a young neil young reincarnate. They will live on, a legit band im glad we found out before we got too old. Signature moment- verse vocal melody.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Glory Bound | The Grass Roots</strong> (C.) A song that has an identical structure to the previous Nick Low Cruel to be kind song. Great verse, great melody that ultimately makes a cash grab for the commercial disco chorus singalong.The chorus is identical to the cruel to be kind chorus just different words.  Hate choruses like these, lacks the angular pop i dont see coming. but its commercial radio so ill just shut up and enoy it for what it is. But dont dig the chorus.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Chocolate Boy | Guided By Voices</strong> (B+.) Sounds like it could have came out at any point in their career. Signature moment- the violin works, never thought id say that in a GBV song. </p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Thirteen Grand | The Wrens</strong> (B.) Hate to say it but marotta would like this band. Has that Americana feel to it. Just a good song, that hooks me because of the signature moment that is the little 2 note guitar riff. I also like that they use a real piano and not a synthesizer.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>I Saw Her Again Last Night | The Mamas and the Papas</strong> (A.) Now they knew how to do choruses. FRAK. Solid tune, a band where the harmonies cant be duplicated no matter who would get together. They are recognizable by almost anyone with a brain. A signature sound indeed. My only problem is I can't get into this song because I know you def had moments listening to it, its a story on your life.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>1% of One | Stephen Malkmus</strong> (B+, honorable mention.) A great tune, catchy and got some weird ass parts in it i dont know how we put together. Signature Moment- picturing you singing one percent of one one percent of one to yourself.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Nothing Comapres 2 U | Sinead O'Connor</strong> (A+.) Perfection, been here did it over and over. Good from time to time. One of the times where a cover blows away the original also. Prince wrote this, but then again he's written almost half the popular music people know.</p>

	 		<h4>"The chorus is like the opening to Melrose Place or something"</h4>
	 		<h5>Mix by KZ, dossier by JJ | March 2013 | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thadzaw/playlist/0CUXBFaLd7urzadUMz6Egg">Listen</a> </h5>
	 		<h5>~</h5>
	 		<p><strong>Fractions and Feelings | Stephen Malkmus</strong> Best song on the mix. An instant classic. Hits you hard, never lets up. This will be in rotation for eternity.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Birdhouse in Your Soul | They Might be Giants</strong> Didn't enjoy this; felt like a Daniel Johnston song. No melody. I hear great things about them though, so I'm not giving up on them yet, keep it coming if you have others.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>xx | Feist</strong> I actually dug this, good beat, love the verse and lyrics. Her voice too was DEBILITATING MY ****.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Liquid Indian | Guided By Voices</strong> Worst song I ever heard. The chorus is like the opening to Melrose Place or something, too poppy for me.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Shatter | Magneta Lane</strong> Way to poppy, sounds like Neon Trees or something. Middle School lyrics.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Sweet Caress | Izzy Stradlin</strong> He's got a great voice, reminds me of a sadder Westerberg.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Good Kid Eggs | Stephen Malkmus</strong> The chorus is awesome, the guitar riff is awesome, another hit for Malkmus.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>KC Accidental | Broken Social Scene</strong> Meh. Don't dig the dude's voice or the techno beats.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>The Singer Not The Song | Alex Chilton</strong> Great cover, Alex Chilton is the man. Really cool, will def be spinning this a lot.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Aisle 13 | Built To Spill</strong> Great BTS song I didn't know. Great riff, ATMOSPHERIC.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Authentic | Young Rival</strong> Good, they are growing on me. Sometimes I hate them, sometimes I like them. This is a class act song, though.</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Skeletons | Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> Yeah Yeah Yeahs are awesome, her voice is SEX</p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Between Something And Nothing | The Ocean Blue</strong> Trying to pinpoint where the fuck they belong in the world but its tasty. </p>
	 		<p style="line-height: 20%">&zwnj;</p>
	 		<p><strong>Max Can't Surf | Fidlar</strong> Nothing original, but we could steal it and get away with it.</p>
